# C-Sharp Projects

These are some of the projects I have been working on that include code in C-Sharp.


## - [Car Insurance](https://github.com/judahkirkwood/CarInsurance)


This is an MVC app created using .NET Framework that creates a Car Insurance quote based on customer input information. 
This web app includes an admin page that allows an Administrator to view details on all quotes that have been issued.

## - [Newsletter](https://github.com/judahkirkwood/C-Projects/tree/main/NewsletterAppMVC)

This is mimicing a website Newsletter signup.

## - [Twenty One Game](https://github.com/judahkirkwood/C-Projects/tree/main/TwentyOne)

This is a game created using C# that emulates the card game Twenty One in a Casino.
